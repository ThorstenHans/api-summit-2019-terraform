# API Summit 2019 Samples

## Infrastructure as Code for everything with Terrafrom (Infrastructure-as-Code f√ºr alle mit Terraform)

This repository contains all the samples from my half-day workshop at API Summit 2019 in Berlin.

## Story

For demonstration purpose these samples contain a single project targeting both major clouds: Azure and AWS. To use the sample code, you need an Azure Account and an AWS Account.

Both providers offer different authentication apporaches. However, I installed Azure CLI and AWS CLI 2.0 on my machine to explain how authentication on a developer machine may look like.

For production usage you should review Terrafrom documentation and use proper authentication mechanisms.
